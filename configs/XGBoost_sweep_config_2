description: Training & Validation sets represent 98% of data, Final hold out Represents 2%. With RandomOverSampling of the Minority Class. Resampling Occurs for each K Fold and the Resampling Percenatage is a Hyper-param that Bayes Optimisation Tunes as there is a trade of between minority signal and overfitting.
